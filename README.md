Lighting education is a foundational component of cinematography education. However, many art schools do not have expensive
soundstages for traditional cinematography lessons. Migrating physical setups to virtual experiences is a potential solution driven
by metaverse initiatives.
That's why we developed Art Mirror, a VR soundstage for teachers and students to emulate cinematography
lighting in virtual scenarios.
